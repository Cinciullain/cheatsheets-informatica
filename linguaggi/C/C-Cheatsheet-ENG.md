### Environment Setup
To execute C code, you have to compile it. 

- **Linux e MacOS:** you need to execute a few commands:
  - Install the essential packages
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install build essential
    ```
    
  - Install gcc, the tool to compile and execute the code
    ```
    % sudo apt install gcc
    ```
    
Open the terminal in the folder where your .c is located,  and compile it with the following command
            ```
            $ gcc -o output.o file.c
            ```.
            
Once compiled, execute the code with: ``` $ ./output.o```

- **Windows:** has the necessity to install different packages, I suggest this [guide](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/mingweclipse/mingw.html).

**NB:** Every OS compile in a different way, so a program compiled and executed on Linux can give different results on MacOS and Windows.

To have more details about the compilation and execution process in C, I suggest this [book](https://www.linuxlinks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/An_Introduction_to_GCC-Brian_Gough.pdf).
